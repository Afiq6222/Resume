While developing my personal resume website, I focused on creating a clean, modern, and user-friendly design. I chose a layout inspired by W3Schools because it's simple, responsive, and easy for users to navigate — especially on both desktop and mobile devices.

I included a home page with a minimal introduction and a “See More” button to make the entry point elegant and focused. The resume page uses a structured layout with sections like About, Biodata, Location, and interactive links like Gmail, WhatsApp, and MyCV download, making it practical and functional for professional use.

One of the challenges I faced was making sure all the pages were correctly linked and visually consistent. It took some trial and error to make sure the navigation bar worked smoothly across different sections and that external links like WhatsApp and Google Maps opened as expected.

From this project, I learned how to properly structure multiple HTML files, reuse CSS across pages, and implement interactive buttons using basic HTML/CSS. Most importantly, I realized the importance of simplicity and clarity in design — making sure the content is readable and accessible without overwhelming the user.

This experience has strengthened my skills in front-end web development and given me confidence to explore more advanced features in the future.
